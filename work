11.1 Create a file called zoo.py. In it, define a function called hours() that prints the string 'Open 9-5 daily'. Then, use the interactive interpreter to import the zoo module and call its hours() function.
# zoo.py
def hours():
    print("Open 9-5 daily")

# In the interactive interpreter
import zoo
zoo.hours()

11.2.

# In the interactive interpreter
import zoo as menagerie
menagerie.hours()

11.2 In the interactive interpreter, import the zoo module as menagerie and call its hours() function.
import zoo as menagerie
menagerie.hours()
     
16.8 Use the sqlalchemy module to connect to the sqlite3 database books.db that you just made in exercise 16.4. As in 16.6, select and print the title column from the book table in alphabetical order.
metadata = MetaData()
books_table = Table('book', metadata, autoload_with=engine)

# Create a database connection
with engine.connect() as connection:
    # Select and print the title column from the book table in alphabetical order
    query = select([books_table.c.title]).order_by(books_table.c.title)
    result = connection.execute(query)

    print("Titles in alphabetical order:")
    for row in result:
        print(row[0])
